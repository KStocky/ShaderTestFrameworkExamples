# ShaderTestFrameworkExamples

Example project that demonstrates how to set up a project to use [Shader Test Framework](https://github.com/KStocky/ShaderTestFramework)

## Getting Started

This should be enough to grab the repo and build everything provided you have a recent install of Visual Studio 2022 and CMake.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/KStocky/ShaderTestFrameworkExamples
$ cd ShaderTestFrameworkExamples
$ cmake --workflow --preset VS2022Build
```

From there you can run the example project and having a look through the CMakeLists.txt to see how you might make use of [Shader Test Framework](https://github.com/KStocky/ShaderTestFramework) in your own projects.

There is also a much more in depth [tutorial](https://github.com/KStocky/ShaderTestFramework/blob/main/docs/Tutorial.md). This describes the requirements in detail, then takes you through how to include the framework in your project, and then how to write tests for your shader code.
